# Solidity Upgrade Practice with Proxy

This repository is a brief practice project focused on upgrading Solidity contracts using a proxy. It contains two simple contracts and demonstrates how to upgrade from one version to another through a proxy contract.

## Overview

- **Contracts:** Two basic Solidity contracts showing different versions.
- **Proxy Contract:** Demonstrates upgrading from one contract to the other.
- **Learning Focus:** Understanding smart contract upgradeability using proxy patterns.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/hardhat-upgrades.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd hardhat-upgrades
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

 

## Learning Outcomes

This project was developed as a practice exercise to:

- Gain hands-on experience with upgrading smart contracts using proxy patterns.
- Understand the mechanics of deploying and testing upgradeable contracts.
- Learn basic principles of smart contract versioning and upgradeability.
